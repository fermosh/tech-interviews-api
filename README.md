#Introduction 
Techinal Interview Helper API.

There's a clearly need of having a system that helps an interviewer from the staff to apply an interview to a new IT candidate. From picking a position and the skills, questions and exercises that are wanted to be evaluated to later save these topics as a template or even further persist it as an interview result, the API has the function to carry these tasks to the end.

The solution consists of three layers:
a) Model
b) Services
c) API

#Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references

#Build and Test
In order to build the solution you should install next dependencies:
a) StyleCop, you can get it from: https://github.com/StyleCop/StyleCop
b) As the data access layer is using Cosmos DB, we can download an emulator of it to start running our local tests => https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator
c) How to import data into Azure Cosmos DB for the DocumentDB API?. The answer is Data Migration tool => https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/import-data
